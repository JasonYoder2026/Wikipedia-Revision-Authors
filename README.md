This project is a small application that takes the title of a Wikipedia article and through Wikimedia API returns the timestamps and usernames of the 15 most recent edits to the article.
If there are less than 15 edits, timestamps and usernames for all edits will be displayed. The application informs the user if they are redirected to a different article, and if there are system errors.
